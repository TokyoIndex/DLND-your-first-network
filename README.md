# DLND Your First Network

In this project, I'll get to build a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset! By building a neural network from the ground up, I'll have a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important to know before I move to higher level tools such as Tensorflow. I'll also get to see how to apply these networks to solve real prediction problems!

The data comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset).
